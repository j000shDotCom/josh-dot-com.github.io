      <description>Update! I really (well &amp;hellip; not much at all) tried to keep this a living document. That did not last long. It is much easier to post snippets of things as time goes on. Be sure to check out my Mastodon.technology profile!

      <description>I have a lot of free time on my (washed) hands whilst staying inside due to COVID-19. I noticed my boyfriend got back into playing the popular Zynga game Words with Friends.
Years ago while on my commute to work, I started dabbling with mitmproxy and monitoring the network traffic and API, but never got to the meat of solving the game.
Thinking of looking back into it now, perhaps as a sequence of interview-type problems.</description>

      <description>Finally getting around to setting up my dotfiles and really learning how to use vim, zsh, stow, and all the tools. Going to jot down some notes for reference.
Also, I must shamefully point out that I wrote this in VS Code with the really handy markdown viewer! Maybe this could be a good first dive into editing with emacs! &amp;hellip; soon™️
Zsh Not sure I have any concrete understanding yet.</description>

      <description>Hello world!
No idea what I am doing, but it looks like things are appearing finally. This sure has been a productive 1.5 hour flight from SFO to PHX!
I am still learning Hugo and how to create, link, and tag new posts. I think I am haphazardly getting the hang of it though. Seems simple enough. Not sure what the difference is between &amp;ldquo;+++&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; when it comes to post/article headers.</description>
